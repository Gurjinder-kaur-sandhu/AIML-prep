# Feature Scaling in Machine Learning

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that explains **Feature Scaling** in detail with proper intuition, mathematical background, and implementation using Python.

## 📌 What is Feature Scaling?

Feature scaling is a preprocessing technique used to bring all input features to a similar scale so that no feature dominates the learning process due to its magnitude.

## 🔍 Why Feature Scaling is Important

* Improves model performance
* Speeds up gradient descent convergence
* Prevents dominance of large-scale features
* Essential for distance-based algorithms

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Why scaling is needed
* StandardScaler (Standardization)
* MinMaxScaler (Normalization)
* Difference between StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler
* fit vs transform vs fit_transform
* Train–test scaling best practices
* When scaling is required and when it is not

## 🧪 Implementation

The notebook demonstrates feature scaling using:

* `StandardScaler`
* `MinMaxScaler`

With:

* Sample dataset
* Proper train-test split
* Output visualization after scaling

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook
